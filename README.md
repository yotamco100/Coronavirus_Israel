# Coronavirus Prediction - Israel
This is a Jupyter notebook that, using TensorFlow, predicts the number of coronavirus patients using a [logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function).

Just put your data in the csv file and run the jupyter notebook. You can also change hyperparameters or batch size, if you'd like.
